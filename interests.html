	Some of my interests include First Tech Challenge.In First Tech Challenge I help build the robot, and I also program the robot to do its specified mission. I program using a software called <a href = "https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrIf3BRD1ARIsAMuugNt7PtFf0HiaWUOHS0Iwh11M3DQCmV1EQbDso56rFQ4kfNp89CROV_EaAhZREALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Android Studio</a>.

I have become interested in modding ever since I downloaded Mr. Crayfish's furniture mod. I am learning modding by watching youtube videos. A notable example of my modding skills would be when I created a rainbow-colored item that has a strong explosion resilience and has a chance of dropping a few diamond blocks.</p>
