    <p>I am in 10th grade currently. I go to Mission San Jose High School. </p> 
    <p>I am a fun loving guy who enjoys figuring out how to improve the gameplay of my favorite game, Minecraft. Thanks to minecraft I know my way around computers. I also enjoy playing with Mods, and a mod I recommend for you minecrafters to have is <a href = "http://www.9minecraft.net/mrcrayfishs-furniture-mod/">Mr Crayfish's furniture Mod</a>.</p>
    <p>I am in Boy Scouts, and I am currently a Life Rank, which is the rank before Eagle. I enjoy the campouts and interacting with my fellow scouts. I have been in Boy Scouts since 2016. I look forward to my weekly meetings, but due to COVID-19 everything has been shut down.</p>
    <p>I am also part of a First Tech Challenge <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/ftc-chocolate-cyborgs-14502/home">Team 14502 Chocolate Cyborgs</a>. If you know anyone who is interested in joining First please contact our team here at <a href = "mailto:ggtower101@gmail.com">ggtower101@gmail.com</a>. In my team I program and I help build the robot. I also 3d modeled one of our team markers using <a href = "https://www.tinkercad.com/">TinkerCAD</a>.</p>
